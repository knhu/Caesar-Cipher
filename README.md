# Caesar-Cipher
# This program will encode a piece of text using a similar method of a Caesar Cipher. This includes moving the letters to a different letter specified by the user in a specific loop, and then the user will input a message to be encoded. The program will encode the message, print it out, then print out the original message (decoded).
